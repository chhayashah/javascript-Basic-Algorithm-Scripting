The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), 
and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement. 

condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
